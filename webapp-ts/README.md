# Project Name

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for.


### Prerequisites

Node version 22

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Development

#### Assets

Use **inline assets** if assets are necessary:

```js
import reactLogo from './assets/react.svg?inline'
```

This does bloat the JS slightly but ultimately simplifies the build process (no path rewrites). Switching to static assets can be done once all the features of the webapp are migrated across
